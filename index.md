# Columbo

Columbo is a shrewd but inelegant blue-collar homicide detective whose trademarks include his rumpled beige raincoat, 
unassuming demeanor, frequent cigar smoking, old Peugeot 403, 
unseen wife (whom he mentions regularly), and catchphrase "Just one more thing." 
His suspects are often affluent members of high society who try to carefully cover their tracks.
